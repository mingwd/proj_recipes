    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Garlicky poached clam with glass noodles. Summer is a great time for seafood and also clay pot dishes. I love to use clay pot because it requires little time in front of fire, comparing with common stir frying recipes.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500 g clam</li>
        <li>100 g golden needle mushrooms</li>
        <li>100 g soaked glass noodles</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>3.5 tbsp. vegetable cooking oil</li>
        <li>½ cup minced garlic</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. minced ginger</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. minced scallion</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. light soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. oyster sauce</li>

    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Soak the freshly bought clam with a very small pinch of salt and oil, so they can spit sands.</li>
        <li>Then heat a large pot of water to a boiling, add ginger and then cook the clams until opened. Don’t over cook in this step. This helps to remove the odd taste.</li>
        <li>In the claypot, place golden needle mushroom in bottom. Then pre-soaked glass noodles in middle and blanched clam on top.</li>
        <li>In a small pan, add 3 tablespoons of vegetable cooking oil and fry garlic, ginger, scallion and chili peppers until aromatic. Add oyster sauce, light soy sauce, salt, sugar and black pepper. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Add 1 cup of water along with the edges . Spread the garlic sauce on the surface of the claypot and cook fro 10 mins.</li>
        <li>Serve hot!</li>
    </ol>
