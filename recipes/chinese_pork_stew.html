        <h2>Description</h2>

        <P>
            Hong Shao Rou (红烧肉) is a popular Shanghainese dish. The literal translation of the dish is red braised pork. It's stewed and cooked in soy sauce and sugar, which gives the sauce a glossy caramelized finish.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>500g pork belly, cut into approximately 3cm cubes</li>
            <li>1 tbsp neutral oil</li>
            <li>20g rock sugar or 2 tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>2 tbsp light soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tbsp dark soy sauce</li>
            <li>¼ cup Shaoxing wine</li>
            <li>600mL water</li>
            <li>3 slices of ginger</li>
            <li>2 star anise pods</li>
            <li>1 tangerine peel (fresh or dry. Any citrus peel will work!)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp chili oil</li>
            <li>Green onions for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Blanch the pork belly. In a pot of boiling water, gently drop the pork belly cubes in. Blanch for 3-4 minutes until the scum rises to the top. This ensures that the impurities won’t be in our final sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
                Rinse your pork chunks for any impurities. Drain and tab excess moisture with a tea towel.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat a heavy duty pot (like a dutch oven or large cast iron with a lid) on medium high heat.
            </li>
            <li>Drizzle in the oil and add the pork.</li>
            <li>Sear the pork on all sides and add the sugar and soy sauce in.</li>
            <li>
                Once the sugar has caramelized and coated the pork, deglaze the pot with Shaoxing wine and water.
            </li>
            <li>Add the ginger, citrus peel, and star anise.</li>
            <li>
                Cover and lower the heat to low. Simmer for 1 hour until the pork is tender. Supplement with more water if the sauce seems too thick / might burn. Alternatively, you can cook this in an instant pot or pressure cooker with 300mL of water for 20 minutes on high pressure.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve on top of rice. Drizzle the glaze on the rice first and plate a generous mountain of pork belly! Garnish with scallions and enjoy!
